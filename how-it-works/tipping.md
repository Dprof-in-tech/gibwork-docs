# Tipping

As an open source maintainer, you have the opportunity to reward your community outside of bounties by giving Tips. Tipping is a way to express gratitude and appreciation to contributors who have given time and effort in contributions to your project either by finding bugs, fixing them or raising issues. Motivated by the traditional means of saying thank you for professional service, Tipping using Gib Works is the digital way of saying “thank you for contributing to my project”.

## Why Tipping Matters

**Visibility**: Tipping serves as a means of telling all contributors to your project that you are aware of their efforts in making it work. It shows them that you care and that their time is Valued.

**Motivation**: Contributors often work on open-source projects voluntarily, driven by their passion for the technology, community or to build credibility. Tipping becomes an extra motivation to contribute more.

**Sustainability**:  Tipping helps sustain your contributor pool  by fostering a sense of belonging to your project and the community. 

## How to Tip using GibWork

Tipping on GibWork is easy and simple. You need to have a GibWork account, submit and verify your project and then add some funds to your project dashboard. The steps to doing this can be found in the [Project Owners Readme](https://github.com/gibwork/gibwork-docs/blob/50e105ea01e2962b60ff111cd4172d9ee9ef32e6/how-it-works/for-project-owners.md) . As long as you have gotten this done, with the new GibWork tipping feature, you can tip contributors directly from your GibWork project dashboard. 

The syntax for tipping using GibWork is as follows:

*@gibworkbot tip amount @username*

Make sure to replace the “amount” with the amount of USDC you want to tip them with and the “username” placeholder with the contributor’s username. Let's say "@Isreal_bigD" found and reported a crucial bug. To show your appreciation with a 25 USDC tip, you'd use:

*@gibwork tip 25 @Isreal_bigD*

The above instruction would tip Israel with 20 USDC tokens.

You can also add a custom thank you for contributing message as follows:

*@gibwork tip 25 @Isreal_bigD Thank you for finding this bug! The team is on it!*

Enjoy the new Tipping feature with GibWork and keep your contributors engaged and contributing.
